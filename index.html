        <p>
        This is a demo AR game, using the <a href="https://inspirit.github.io/jsfeat/">jsfeat</a> CV library.<br/>
        It was meant to be played from a car, but the frame rate usually is not high enough :/<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
        Anyway, I think it's a nice demo for using optical flow tracking in implementing AR apps.

        <p>
        Best used on an Android mobile device (iPhones don't support getUserMedia as of this writing).

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
        Simply move your phone around so the flowers / fruits enter the monster's mouth.
