        <p>
        This is a demo AR game, using the <a href="https://inspirit.github.io/jsfeat/">jsfeat</a> CV library.<br/>
        It was meant to be played from a car, but the frame rate usually is not high enough :/<br/>
        Anyway, I think it shows nice use for optical flow tracking for implementing AR apps.

        Best used on an Android mobile device (iPhones don't support getUserMedia as of this writing)
