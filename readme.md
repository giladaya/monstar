# The Monstar
This is a demo AR game, which uses the [jsfeat](https://inspirit.github.io/jsfeat/) CV library.  
It was initially meant to be played from a car, but the frame rate usually is not high enough :/  
  
Anyway, I think it's a nice demo for using optical flow tracking in implementing AR apps.  
  
## Important!
The game only makes sense when played on a mobile device, and it was only tested with Chrome 52 for Android (should work with later versions too).  
Also, as of this writing, iPhones don't support getUserMedia which is needed by the app, so no point trying.
