# The Monstar
This is a demo AR game, which uses the [jsfeat](https://inspirit.github.io/jsfeat/) CV library.  
It was initially meant to be played from a car, but the frame rate usually is not high enough :/  
  
Anyway, I think it's a nice demo for using optical flow tracking in implementing AR apps.  
  
Try it on an Android mobile device as iPhones don't support getUserMedia as of this writing.
